# Screws-Fasteners-and-Bolted-joints-in-tension
##### For the first part of this project, spherical pressure vessel was designed. It was fabricated of two different materials (Material A for the top with flange and Material B for the bottom with flange). The two halves were bolted together using grade 8.2 steel fasteners. It was anticipated the sphere will need to be disassembled and reassembled periodically.As such, for this part we had to:
  * Determine the minimum wall thickness for each hemisphere.
  * Determine the Numbers of fully threaded fasteners required for a static safety factor of 1.55
  * Determine the Factor of safety for against separation, interpret the results (comment).

##### For the second part of the project, a cantilever bracket made of AISI 1020 hot rolled steel fastened to a column with three shoulder bolts was analized in order to determine the maximun allowed force for a givens safety factor.
